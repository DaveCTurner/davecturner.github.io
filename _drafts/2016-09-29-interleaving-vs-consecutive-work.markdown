Consider two "equally important" jobs.

If job length is fixed, prefer consecutive as it delivers the first job
quicker, rather than both of them right near the end.

But this seems counterintuitive & managers seem not to like it.

If job A overruns then consecutive work pushes job B's delivery back too
whereas interleaved => job B delivered as expected.

However, if you switched from job A at the point where it should have finished,
get the same answer.
