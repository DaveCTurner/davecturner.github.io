Sometimes it's useful to represent all the odd keys on a Mac OS keyboard with their proper glyphs in a textual conversation. There's various ways to do that but honestly the easiest for me is just to search for a web page that contains the right glyphs and copy-paste them into the chat. Recently I've found that becoming less effective, requiring several different searches before finally finding a good page, so I'm recording them here where I can find them more easily.

| Glyph | Description
|-------|-------
|   ⌘   | Command
|   ⌥   | Option
|   ⌃   | Control
|   ⇧   | Shift
|   ⇪   | Caps lock
|   ␣   | Space
|   ⇥   | Tab
|   ↑   | Up arrow
|   ↓   | Down arrow
|   ←   | Left arrow
|   →   | Right arrow
|   ⏎   | Enter
|   ⏏   | Eject
|   ⌫   | Delete
