title:  "Unicode glyphs for Mac OS keyboard modifiers"

Sometimes it's useful to represent all the odd keys on a Mac OS keyboard with
their proper glyphs in a textual conversation. There's various ways to do that
but honestly the easiest for me is just to search for a web page that contains
the right glyphs and copy-paste them into the chat. Recently I've found that
becoming less effective, requiring several different searches before finally
finding a good page, so I'm recording them here where I can find them more
easily.

| Glyph | Description
|-------|-------
|   ⌘   | Command
|   ⌥   | Option
|   ⌃   | Control
|   ⇧   | Shift
|   ⇪   | Caps lock
|   ␣   | Space
|   ⇥   | Tab
|   ↑   | Up arrow
|   ↓   | Down arrow
|   ←   | Left arrow
|   →   | Right arrow
|   ⏎   | Enter
|   ⏏   | Eject
|   ⌫   | Delete
